What “personal assistant” means in your app

Think of it as 3 layers:

Conversational helper (voice + chat)

Talks like a real person, in plain language

Explains options and asks only what’s needed

Reads things out loud and can accept voice replies

Workflow engine (Activepieces)

Runs automations: reminders, document requests, drafting forms, routing to a case worker

Connects to email/SMS/WhatsApp (where allowed), calendar, storage, CRM-like case board

Verification + approval (human-in-the-loop)

A helper/case worker approves drafts, messages, and submissions

Full audit trail of what the AI suggested and why

Must-have assistant features (the “wow” core)
1) Voice-first intake (ElevenLabs + your UI)

A “Start a scan” button: user speaks, assistant asks follow-ups

Output is a structured Situation Profile (not a blob of text)

Always shows a summary screen:
“Here’s what I understood. Edit anything.”

Key UX: user can switch between voice and text at any time.

2) Personalized eligibility coaching

Assistant should:

present top 3 highest-impact supports first (“most money / fastest / lowest paperwork”)

explain why each match appears (“because you live in X…”)

ask missing questions only when needed (“To confirm, is your rent above/below…?”)

provide a “confidence” label + what would confirm it

3) “Next step” autopilot (with approval gates)

Assistant can automatically:

create a checklist of missing documents

generate drafts (forms, cover letters, explanation texts)

schedule reminders (“upload payslip before Friday”)

prepare a handoff package to a case worker

But it cannot:

submit applications

send messages to municipalities/funds as if final

take irreversible actions

Instead it produces Drafts → Review → Send/Submit.

4) Proactive reminders + nudges

This is where Activepieces shines:

deadlines/renewals reminders

“still missing doc X” nudges

“status check” pings

“don’t forget to update income change” reminders

You can make reminders feel supportive:

“Want me to remind you tomorrow morning or next week?”

5) Human handoff that feels natural

At any point the assistant can say:

“Would you like a helper to review this before we continue?”
and then:

send a structured case summary + drafts to the helper dashboard

start a chat thread with the helper (user doesn’t feel abandoned)

Recommended flows you can automate with Activepieces
Flow A — “Eligibility scan → matches → action plan”

Trigger: user finishes intake
Steps:

call matching service (rules + LLM explanations)

save matches + reasoning

generate “Top 3 next steps”

notify user (in-app + optional WhatsApp/SMS/email)

create tasks in “My timeline”

Flow B — “Document request loop”

Trigger: user selects a scheme
Steps:

produce scheme-specific doc checklist

schedule reminders until docs received

when docs uploaded: notify helper for review if required

update readiness status (“ready to draft / ready for review”)

Flow C — “Draft application packet”

Trigger: all required info/docs present
Steps:

prefill form fields from profile

generate cover letter / explanation (LLM)

package into “Draft submission”

route to helper queue for approval

once approved: user can download/send or helper submits via official channel

Flow D — “Renewal tracker”

Trigger: benefit activated
Steps:

store renewal date + required evidence types

send reminders at T-30 / T-14 / T-3 days

build renewal draft packet

route to helper for review

How ElevenLabs fits (practically)

ElevenLabs gives you:

TTS (assistant speaks) → great for low literacy and trust

STT depends on your stack (ElevenLabs has STT options, or you can use another provider)
Either way, you want:

voice input → text → structured extraction → confirmation UI

text output → ElevenLabs speech for playback

Must-have controls:

“Play / Pause / Repeat”

“Show transcript”

“Switch to text mode”

“Privacy mode” (no voice stored, if possible)

The guardrails you should implement (to satisfy the constraints)

These are design-level, not “later”.

A) Action permissions (“capabilities”)

Tag actions by risk:

Low risk: reminders, checklists, explanations

Medium: drafting documents, generating prefilled fields

High: sending to external parties, submitting applications, changing official records

Only allow:

low/medium automatically

high only with explicit approval (helper + user)

B) Consent & visibility

show what data is used for each recommendation

allow “answer in ranges” (income band) before exact numbers

“export my case” and “delete my data” buttons

C) Audit trail

For every recommendation/draft:

source schemes + last verified date

the fields used (not raw sensitive docs)

what’s missing

who approved what

Extra assistant features that build trust

“You’re in control” language: “I can draft it — you decide.”

A “What happens next?” screen after every step

A “Why are you asking this?” button on sensitive questions

A “Safety check” before submission: common mistakes + risks

A realistic hackathon MVP for this assistant

If you want something that feels like the whole product but is doable:

Voice/text intake → Situation Profile

Match against 8–12 schemes (1 municipality + 1 national set)

Show top matches with plain-language explanations

“Generate draft packet” (prefill + cover letter)

Helper review page (approve / ask changes)

Activepieces reminders for 1 deadline flow

That’s already a legit “personal assistant”, not a demo chatbot.
